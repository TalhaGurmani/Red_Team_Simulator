## üî• Red Team Campaign Simulator

**Red Team Campaign Simulator** is an educational web based cybersecurity platform that allows users to create virtual network environments, assign CVEs mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and simulate deterministic red team attack campaigns.  
It provides visual representations of attack paths, tracks techniques, and generates detailed Markdown or PDF reports without performing any real network operations.


## Features

### üéØ Host Management
- Create and manage virtual network hosts  
- Configure IP addresses, operating systems, and open ports  
- Assign vulnerabilities from a CVE database  
- Set business criticality levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)

### ‚öîÔ∏è Campaign Simulation
- Deterministic turn based attack modeling  
- Multi phase attack progression (Initial Access ‚Üí Reconnaissance ‚Üí Exploitation ‚Üí Lateral Movement)  
- Reproducible results using random seeds  
- MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping for each attack step  

## Network Visualization
- Interactive graph visualization using Cytoscape.js  
- Real time attack progression display  
- Visual indicators for compromised hosts  
- Network topology and relationship analysis  

## Attack Logging and Reporting
- Real time console style attack logs  
- Detailed timeline of each simulated attack  
- MITRE ATT&CK technique tracking  
- Downloadable Markdown or PDF reports containing:  
  - Executive summaries  
  - Attack timelines  
  - Technique analysis  
  - Remediation recommendations  

## üß∞ Technology Stack

**Backend**

## üîß Usage Guide

### 1. Add Virtual Hosts

- Navigate to **Host Management**
- Add a new host with details such as name, IP address, OS, and open ports
- Assign vulnerabilities from the built in CVE database
- Choose a business criticality level

### 2. Create and Run Campaigns

- Go to the **Campaigns** section
- Provide a campaign name and description
- Select target hosts or use random targeting
- Execute the campaign to begin simulation

### 3. View and Export Results

- Observe attack progression in the **Network Visualization** panel
- Review all actions in the **Attack Logs**
- Generate and download a detailed **PDF or Markdown report**
